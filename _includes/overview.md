<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Overview</h2>

My research expertise lies in <u><strong>machine learning</strong></u> and <u><strong>wearable devices</strong></u>. In particular, I am interested in machine learning for robotics and medicine based on continuous data collected by wearables. Most recently, I have been exploring using **foundation models** for human health assessment. My research currently has three goals:
<div style="margin-left: 10px;"><strong>(1)</strong>
    develop robust wearable sensors 
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 10px;"><strong>(2)</strong>
efficient data processing and model prediction for time-series multimodal biosignals datastream;
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 10px;"><strong>(3)</strong>
advance robotics and health assessment with computationally efficient foundation models.
