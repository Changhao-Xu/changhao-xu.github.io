<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/). I hold a subject major in [Medical Engineering](https://mede.caltech.edu/), where I am fortunate to to be advised by [Prof. Wei Gao](https://www.gao.caltech.edu/). I also hold a subject minor in [Computer Science](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/grad/grad_cs), where I am fortunate to to be advised by [Prof. Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/). I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yongfeng Mei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6EFvn5wAAAAJ&hl=en). As part of the [Cross-disciplinary Scholars in Science & Technology program](https://www.facebook.com/uclaCSST/), I conducted summer undergraduate research supervised by [Prof. Xiangfeng Duan](http://xduan.chem.ucla.edu/) at the [University of California Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/). In 2016, I was an exchange student in Physics at the [University of California Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/).

My research interests are in the intersections of **electronic skin**, **machine learning**, **robotics** and **personalized medicine**, spanning the spectrum from wearable sensors development, algorithm design, to applications in robotics and diagnostics.

To that end, my research has three goals: **(1) develop advanced materials and systems for continuous long-term monitoring; (2) bridge sensor data with robotics and health information through an autonomous machine learning pipeline; and (3) advance intelligent robotic control and health assessment using smart sensors.**

<strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600"><strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600">I am currently on the 2024 job market, looking for postdoc positions related to Electronic Skin, Wearable Devices, and Artificial Intelligence. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested. I am also happy to give talks on my research and discuss research proposals.</strong></strong>
