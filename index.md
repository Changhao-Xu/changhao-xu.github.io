<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. at [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/). I hold a subject major in [Medical Engineering](https://mede.caltech.edu/), where I am fortunate to to be advised by [Prof. Wei Gao](https://www.gao.caltech.edu/). I also hold a subject minor in [Computer Science](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/grad/grad_cs), where I am fortunate to to be advised by [Prof. Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/). I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yongfeng Mei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6EFvn5wAAAAJ&hl=en). As part of the [Cross-disciplinary Scholars in Science & Technology program](https://www.facebook.com/uclaCSST/), I conducted summer undergraduate research supervised by [Prof. Xiangfeng Duan](http://xduan.chem.ucla.edu/) at the [University of California Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/). In 2016, I was an exchange student in Physics at the [University of California Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/).

My research interests lie in <u><strong>machine learning</strong></u> and <u><strong>wearable devices</strong></u>. In particular, I am interested in machine learning for robotics and medicine based on continuous data collected by wearables. Most recently, I have been exploring using **foundation models** for human health assessment. My research currently has three goals:
<div style="margin-left: 10px;"><strong>(1)</strong>
    develop robust wearable sensors in an integrated electronic skin for continuous monitoring;
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 10px;"><strong>(2)</strong>
efficient data processing and model prediction for time-series multimodal biosignals datastream;
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 10px;"><strong>(3)</strong>
advance robotics and health assessment with computationally efficient foundation models.
</div>
