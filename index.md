<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I am a postdoc at Stanford University, advised by [Prof. Zhenan Bao](https://baogroup.stanford.edu/people/postdoctoral-scholars). I am a newly minted Ph.D. from [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/). I received my degree from [Medical Engineering](https://mede.caltech.edu/) and [Computer Science](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/grad/grad_cs), advised by [Prof. Wei Gao](https://www.gao.caltech.edu/) and [Prof. Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/).

I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Yongfeng Mei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6EFvn5wAAAAJ&hl=en). I conducted summer undergraduate research supervised by [Prof. Xiangfeng Duan](http://xduan.chem.ucla.edu/) at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/) as part of the [CSST program](https://www.facebook.com/uclaCSST/) in 2017. I was an exchange student in Physics at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/) in 2016.

<strong>This is what I do</strong>

<ul>
  <li>I work on machine learning (teach machines to enhance decision-making) and data science (extract insights from complex data).</li>
  <li>I do software. I write models, pipelines, and apps. I enjoy learning and problem solving.</li>
  <li>I work on wearable devices (design health solutions through sensors).</li>
  <li>I do hardware. I make sensors, electronics, and integrated platforms. I am always the first to test these wearables on myself.</li>
</ul>

<strong>This is what I did</strong>

<ul>
  <li>I developed robust physiological and biochemical sensors in an integrated wearable platform for continuous monitoring.</li>
  <li>I wrote machine learning models for time-series multimodal biosignals datastream.</li>
  <li>I wrote a doctoral thesis titled <a href="https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/16297/">Electronic Skin in Robotics and Healthcare: Towards Multimodal Sensing and Intelligent Analysis</a>.</li>
</ul>

<strong>This is what I hope</strong>

<ul>
  <li>You feel happy and you have a good day.</li>
  <li>You are interested in <a href="/research/">my research</a> (or you pretend to be :) ).</li>
  <li>Please feel free to contact me for any opportunities.</li>
</ul>
